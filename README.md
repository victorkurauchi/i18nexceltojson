# i18nexceltojson
Create a .json based on an existent .xlsx translated sheet (i18n utils)

## Context
Considering you need to create .json where the key is your original idiom and the value is the translated idiom. You have a excel sheet where someone translated all the words/sentences, having a header with both idioms.

Running this script you'll be able to output the desired json.

## Why ?
Because if you end up using node-i18n, you'll probably want to use this lib.
